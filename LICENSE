# Want me to put this directly into your GitHub README?

I can generate a **README.md file** for your repo with:
- Badges (Stars, Forks, License, CodeFactor, Laravel version)
- Screenshots section with placeholders  
- API docs  
- Installation commands nicely formatted  
- Contribution guide  

Just say **“Add badges”** or **“Add screenshots section”** or **“Add API docs”**  
and I’ll upgrade your README further.
